Hey there ðŸ‘‹!

I'm Jonathan Marcantonio. I am currently a third-year Computer Science student studying at the University of Toronto Mississauga.


I love to work on exciting little projects all the time. If I'm not working on some project, I am probably deeply entrenched in a 4x strategy game.


You can checkout what I'm currently doing, on my Github [@lennysgarage][github]. 


Feel free to connect with me below.
